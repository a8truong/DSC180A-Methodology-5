1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
   The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was learning about LLMs in practice and what aspects they struggle with.
2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
   A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Proeject is guardrails for chatbots used for mental health. For a sensitive topic like mental health, it's extremely important to have guardrails in place to ensure that the LLM is not causing any harm, and directing the user to proper resources if things go beyond a mental health bot's scope. It's also important that there are no privacy breaches. 
3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
   A potential change I'd make to what I've done for my current Quarter 1 Project is to shrink the scope a little more, as my current approach is a little too wide.
4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
   Some other techniques I would be interested in using in my project would be to use PAIR to try to jailbreak my existing guardrails in order to refine it, and to get more data to use.
